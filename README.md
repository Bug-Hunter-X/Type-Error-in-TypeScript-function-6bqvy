This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The function `greeter` expects a string argument, but it is called with an array of strings. This causes a type error.

The solution demonstrates how to correct the error by either modifying the function signature to accept an array or accessing the array element appropriately.
